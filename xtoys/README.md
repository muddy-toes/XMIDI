This is the source to my XToys script for this control.  It's not published because mine is the only one of these
currently.  If you build one and want to use it, let me know and I'll just publish the script on XToys.

To set it up in xtoys:

  - Open the menu (three lines)
  - Select Scripts under Manage Your Data
  - Click the + in the bottom corner
  - Click the three dots in the top bar
  - Select Import/Export
  - Replace the contents of the editor with the xtoys-script.json file from this directory (copy/paste)
  - Click Save
  - Give it a name and Save it

  - Open the menu (three lines)
  - Select Dashboard Mode
  - Click the + in the top bar to add a block
  - Select Tools
  - Select MIDI
  - Select the script you just created

  - If your OSSM or other speed/position stroker block isn't already added, add it.
  - Click the plug icon in the MIDI block to connect it to your stroker.
  - Plug in your controller
  - Click the gray button in the MIDI block to enable it and select your device from the dropdown that
    appears.
